Flash Chat

My Goal

To create Flash Chat that is an internet-based messaging app similar to WhatsApp, the popular messaging app that was bought by Facebook for $22 billion. I used a service called Firebase Firestore as a backend database to store and retrieve messages from the cloud.

One of the most fundamental components of modern iOS apps is the Table View. Table Views are used everywhere from the Mail app to the Messages app. It’s a crucial part of every iOS developer’s tool belt. In this application, I built the view based on Table Views, creating custom cells, and making my own cloud-based backend database.
